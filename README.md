# HelloJava

My first tryouts coding in java by myself, first touch with GitHub and "play" with intelliJ

Exercises come from

http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/java/J1a_Introduction.html

In my opinion and for my brain - it is very good tutorial with some of  schedules even animated gifs. 
They are very helpful in "catch idea" for people like me.
